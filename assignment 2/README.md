## Regression Task:

Goal: Predict cholesterol levels (chol).

Model: ElasticNet Regression (combines L1 and L2 regularization).

Evaluation metrics: RÂ² and RMSE.

Hyperparameters tuned: alpha and l1_ratio.

Heatmaps visualize model performance across different parameter combinations.

## Classification Task:

Goal: Predict presence of heart disease (num) as a binary label.

Models used: Logistic Regression and k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN).

Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, F1 Score, AUROC, and AUPRC.

Hyperparameter tuning for logistic regression (penalty, solver) and k-NN (n_neighbors).

Plots generated: ROC Curve and Precision-Recall Curve for best model.

## Structure:

Data/heart_disease_uci.csv: Raw dataset.

Scripts/main.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook with full implementation.

README.md: Documentation and instructions.
